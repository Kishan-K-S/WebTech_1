            India.

              <h1>BMTC Buses:</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                BMTC stands for Bangalore Metropolitan Transportation Corporation. It is one of the best city bus
                service provider of our Nation.
                Its operated by the Government of karnataka, which provides many type os services to each and every
                corner of Bangalore at very very cheap cost. BMTC drivers are ones among the best drivers of India,
                moving like pros in the heavy traffics in Bangalore. Currently the volvo service except the Airport
                service are shut down due to Covid. It operates buses round the clock and even frequency is adjusted
                as per the demand. One can move around Bangalore to any corner at ease using these buses. But
                frequency is not very high on the places with less demand and crowd.
                One can easily check the live timings and availability on Google Maps and plan your trips
                accordingly.

              <h1>NAMMA METRO:</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                Bangalore Metro, locally known as Namma Metro (meaning 'Our Metro' in Kannada), serves the city of
                Bangalore. Two lines currently operate from North to South and from East to West. This has became
                the lifeline of Bangalore people due to it's cheaper cost, very less time to travel as well as
                comfort. The multiple stations around the line helps commuters to reach their station on daily
                basis. It helps to connect major places like Vidhana Soudha, Chinnaswamy Stadium, majestic, MG Road,
                KR Market and many such others. Also many new other lines are under construction, and if that
                finishes then almost all the places of Bangalore can be covered using Metro which helps to save to a
                very large extent. They also provide great facilities like parking space, smart car and many others
                which helpes the people to travel safe and efficiently.

              <h1>CABS and AUTO RICKSHAWs:</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                Cabs and Rickshaws play a very important role of transportation in Bangalore. They become very
                necessary to commute long as well as short distances where no public transportation is available.
                Many private cab services like Ola, Uber, Meru and many others provide best service to and fro KIAL.
                Even the ones run by KSTDC also provide better service. They can be easily booked by a tap in their
                respective apps and are very convinient to travel around Bangalore. Even rickshaws can be booked
                under Ola,Uber apps and can be used to move around Bangalore. But one has to be very careful with
                the Rickshaw drivers as new comers are easily fooled by them, so it's better to use Ola or Uber for
                convenient transportation.

              <h1>Self Driven Bikes and Cars:</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                If you are planning to visit Bangalore in a group and wish to visit lot of places here and there,
                then one would suggest them to save their time and money. many bike firms like Bounce, Royal
                Brothers, Roadpanda, Vogo and car firms like Zoomcar, Drivezy, Vroom and many others rent vehicles
                on
                time basis and charge accordingly. They are also very good to use and easily availbale. But its
                better to book in advance and it difficult to get one during weekends. They can aslo be booked with
                their sites and apps. It's mandatory to have valid license prior to booking.

                location. You can easily differentiate the tourist bus in Bangalore with other normal buses. There
                is a short view of the beautiful city’s prominent architecture includes the Palace of Bangalore,
                Vidhana Soudha, Museum, Cubbon Park, Gavi Gangadheswra Temple and many more.
                There are currently only seven running tourist buses in Bangalore, and all of them are fully
                air-conditioned. All these seven buses start from seven different locations daily. All the locations
                are divided so well that it will cover the entire city and help the tourist explore popular areas.
